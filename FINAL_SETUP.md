# 🚀 Final Setup - Complete WIX to ElevenLabs Auto-Calling Pipeline

Your system is now **complete** and will automatically call leads when they submit WIX forms! Here's your final setup checklist:

## ✅ What's Been Added

I've just added the **outbound call trigger** - the missing piece that makes your WIX form submissions automatically initiate phone calls through ElevenLabs.

### 🔥 New Features:
- **Auto-Calling**: WIX form submissions now automatically trigger outbound calls
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Configuration Testing**: New endpoint to verify your ElevenLabs setup
- **Smart Delays**: 2-second delay ensures data is stored before calling

## 🔧 Required Configuration

### Step 1: Get Your ElevenLabs Credentials

1. **API Key**: Go to https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
   - Create a new API key if needed
   - Copy the key

2. **Agent ID**: Go to your ElevenLabs Conversational AI dashboard
   - Select your "Penny" agent
   - Copy the Agent ID from the URL or settings

### Step 2: Add Credentials to .env File

Edit your `.env` file and add these lines:

```bash
# ElevenLabs API Configuration (REQUIRED for outbound calls)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=your_actual_agent_id_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Complete Pipeline

### Test 1: Verify ElevenLabs Configuration

```bash
curl https://cojovi.ngrok.dev/api/test/call-config
```

You should see: `✅ ElevenLabs API configured and ready for outbound calls`

### Test 2: End-to-End Test (Full Pipeline)

```bash
# Submit a test lead (this will trigger an actual call!)
curl -X POST https://cojovi.ngrok.dev/api/webhooks/wix \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "submissionId": "test-12345",
    "contact": {
      "name": { "first": "Test", "last": "User" },
      "phones": [{ "e164Phone": "+15551234567" }]
    },
    "submissions": [{
      "value": {
        "field:notes": "This is a test call from the WIX pipeline"
      }
    }]
  }'
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: This will initiate a real call to the phone number you specify!

## 📞 The Complete Flow

Now when someone fills out your WIX form:

```
1. 📝 User submits WIX form
2. 🔄 WIX sends webhook to your server
3. 💾 Server normalizes and stores lead data
4. 🚀 Server automatically triggers outbound call via ElevenLabs
5. 📞 ElevenLabs/Twilio dials the lead's phone number
6. 🤖 When call connects, ElevenLabs fetches lead data from your server
7. 💬 Penny starts conversation with all the lead's context!
```

## 🔗 Your URLs for WIX & ElevenLabs

**WIX Webhook URL**: `https://cojovi.ngrok.dev/api/webhooks/wix`
**ElevenLabs Fetch URL**: `https://cojovi.ngrok.dev/api/elevenlabs/init`

## 📊 New Server Output

When you restart, you'll see:

```
🚀 WIX to ElevenLabs Ingest System
📡 Server running on port 3000
📋 Available endpoints:
   POST /api/webhooks/wix   - WIX webhook (ingest + auto-call)
   GET  /api/test/call-config - Test ElevenLabs config

📊 Environment:
   ElevenLabs API: ✅ Configured / ❌ Missing (required for calls)
   ElevenLabs Agent: ✅ Set / ❌ Missing (required for calls)
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security & Testing
- **Test Carefully**: The system will make real calls when leads are submitted
- **Phone Numbers**: Make sure test phone numbers are yours or you have permission
- **Rate Limiting**: The system includes retry logic but respects API limits

### Production Considerations
- **Redis**: Consider setting up Upstash Redis for production persistence
- **Monitoring**: Watch the logs for call success/failure rates
- **Error Handling**: The system gracefully handles API failures without blocking WIX webhooks

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your complete WIX → ElevenLabs → Twilio pipeline is now operational. When someone fills out your WIX form, Penny will automatically call them with their personalized context!

### Next Actions:
1. ✅ Add ElevenLabs credentials to `.env`
2. ✅ Restart server and verify config
3. ✅ Test with your own phone number
4. ✅ Configure WIX webhook URL
5. ✅ Go live!

The system will now automatically turn every WIX form submission into an intelligent, personalized phone call. 🚀📞
