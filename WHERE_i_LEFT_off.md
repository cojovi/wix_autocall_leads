⏺ Good! Now let me test with a call that has proper names to see if the agent will now stay connected:

⏺ Bash(curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/wix -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
        "data": {…)
  ⎿  {                                         
       "ok": true,
       "submissionId": "test-proper-names-456",
     … +16 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Great! The call was initiated successfully. Let me check the logs to see what first message variables were sent:

⏺ BashOutput(Reading shell output (filtered: Dynamic variables being sent|honorific|last_name|first_name))
  ⎿        'field:first_name_b9ed': 'Michael',
           'field:last_name_072b': 'Johnson',
     📋 Dynamic variables being sent: {
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see the variables being sent properly:
  - "honorific": "Mr." ✅
  - "last_name": " Johnson" ✅ (with space for proper formatting)
  - "first_name": "Michael" ✅

  Based on your first message template:
  Hi {{honorific}}{{last_name}}{{last_name_suffix}}, this is {{agent_name}} with CMAC Roofing...

  This should now render as: "Hi Mr. Johnson, this is Penny with CMAC Roofing..."

⏺ The first message variables should now be properly formatted. The issue was that your agent's first message template expected specific variable formats, and we
  were sending:
  - Empty names (causing "Hi Mr.Customer")
  - Generic source_site: "wix_form" instead of user-friendly text
  - Missing proper spacing in the name formatting

  Now Fixed:
  - ✅ Sends actual names when available: "Michael" and "Johnson"
  - ✅ Proper spacing: "last_name": " Johnson" (note the leading space)
  - ✅ User-friendly site reference: "source_site": "our website"
  - ✅ Proper request type: "roofing inquiry" instead of form names

  The agent should now stay connected and deliver a proper first message like:
  "Hi Mr. Johnson, this is Penny with CMAC Roofing. Did you just submit a form on our website for a roofing inquiry?"

  Test this with a real form submission to see if the call now stays connected instead of hanging up immediately.

> stop the server for now, im going to come back to trying to fix this later

⏺ Kill Shell(Kill shell: e3c797)
  ⎿  Shell e3c797 killed

⏺ Server stopped.

  Summary of current status:
  - ✅ API integration is working correctly (successful calls with real Twilio Call SIDs)
  - ✅ Fixed first message variable formatting to match your agent template
  - ⚠️  Calls still hanging up immediately (likely agent configuration issue in ElevenLabs dashboard)

  Next steps when you return:
  1. Test if the improved first message variables fixed the hangup issue
  2. If still hanging up, check ElevenLabs agent settings for WebSocket/streaming configuration
  3. Verify agent is properly set up for phone calls vs just chat

  The code integration is solid - the remaining issue is likely in the ElevenLabs agent configuration itself.
